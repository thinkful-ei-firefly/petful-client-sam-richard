## Description

The Petful app allows users to adopt from an animal shelter. The animal shelter only allows people to adopt the oldest pet currently with the shelter, so users may only choose to adopt the first cat or the first dog in the queue of potential pets. Users are able to enter their name into a queue of interested pet adopters and will be able to choose to adopt a cat or dog when it is their turn in the queue. While awaiting their turn, users will have a chance to look through many of the pets the shelter has even those that are yet to be up for adoption.
